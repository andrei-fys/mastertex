  doi = {10.1103/PhysRevB.53.1814},
  abstract = {Quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) calculations are only possible in finite systems and so solids and liquids must be modeled using small simulation cells subject to periodic boundary conditions. The resulting finite-size errors are often corrected using data from local-density functional or Hartree-Fock calculations, but systematic errors remain after these corrections have been applied. The results of our jellium QMC calculations for simulation cells containing more than 600 electrons confirm that the residual errors are significant and decay very slowly as the system size increases. We show that they are sensitive to the form of the model Coulomb interaction used in the simulation cell Hamiltonian and that the usual choice, exemplified by the Ewald summation technique, is not the best. The finite-size errors can be greatly reduced and the speed of the calculations increased by a factor of 20 if a better choice is made. Finite-size effects plague most methods used for extended Coulomb systems and many of the ideas in this paper are quite general: they may be applied to any type of quantum or classical Monte Carlo simulation, to other many-body approaches such as the GW method, and to Hartree-Fock and density-functional calculations.},

However, when abstract concepts are introduced, students often hit a wall. Instructors seem to agree that certain concepts (such as linear independence, spanning, subspace, vector space, and linear transformations) are not easily understood and require time to assimilate. These concepts are fundamental to the study of linear algebra, so students' understanding of them is vital to mastering the subject. This text makes these concepts more accessible by introducing them early in a familiar, concrete Rn  setting, developing them gradually, and returning to them throughout the text so that when they are discussed in the abstract, students are readily able to understand.},

  shorttitle = {Modern {{Quantum Chemistry}}},
  abstract = {The aim of this graduate-level textbook is to present and explain, at other than a superficial level, modem ab initio approaches to the calculation of the electronic structure and properties of molecules. The first three chapters contain introductory material culminating in a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation.The remaining four chapters describe a variety of more sophisticated approaches, which improve upon this approximation. Among the highlights of the seven chapters are (1) a review of the mathematics (mostly matrix algebra) required for the rest of the book, (2) an introduction to the basic techniques, ideas, and notations of quantum chemistry, (3) a thorough discussion of the Hartree-Fock approximation, (4) a treatment of configuration interaction (Cl) and approaches incorporating electron correlation, (5) a description of the independent electron pair approximation and a variety of more sophisticated approaches that incorporate coupling between pairs, (6) a consideration of the perturbative approach to the calculation of the correlation energy of many-electron systems and (7) a brief introduction to the use of the one-particle many-body Green\&\#39;s function in quantum chemistry. Over 150 exercises, designed to help the reader acquire a working knowledge of the material, are embedded in the text. The book is largely self-contained and requires no prerequisite other than a solid undergraduate physical chemistry course; however, some exposure to quantum chemistry will enhance the student\&\#39;s appreciation of the material. Clear and well-written, this text is ideal for the second semester of a two-semester course in quantum chemistry, or for a special topics course.},
